% Facts in Prolog are clauses with a head with no variables and no body
% They are mainly used as declarative statements about a problem domain.
% They are expressed as:
% R(X,Y,...). 
% where R is a relation between some objects X, Y,... that is true.
% It can also be considered as a definition. 
% In other words, the clause R(X,Y,...). returns true.  

good(Bob). % translates to Bob is good.
